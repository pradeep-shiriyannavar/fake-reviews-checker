Classy product,"Far better than Earbuds of so called high brands.... It's just W......O.......W 🎧🎵 what a bear 💓💓 I am a Bass lover, but in this bass & treble crystal clear, no distortion... Also in voice call no prb happen, other person can hears clearly. Great 10 meter bluetooth range 👍👍 I am hearing with 40% sound. Just set your Equaliser & have fun with a Hollywood movie.... You feel ur in Cinema 😎😎.",Flipkart Customer,REAL
Good choice,For battery I could give 10 star if possible......pvc plastic is just okay. But voice on calling is crystal clear because of cvc technology. Earlier my wife always complain about my voice when I was using other Bluetooth earphone while calling but now she is happy and me too........ Don't take it otherwise I work out of station ....lol.,Manish Kumar Meena,REAL

Good quality product,"Delivered in 20 February.. today is 28 February and i didn't charge it till now still battery percentage is 70%.. i use it daily for online classes, 1 movie and 3 hours For music approx 9-10 hours daily so Battery is very Powerfull.it's housing is made by plastic and neck wire of somewhat soft silicone material cable is flat long and strong enough..Bass is above the best if you use right size of ear buds..even in 90% volume vocals are crystal clear treble is well balanced..Call quality is far....",Pankaj Kumar,REAL
Must buy!,"Writing this review after using more than 15 days. 255F pro+ has super sound quality. Bass is decent and fair enough. Most important highlight of this headset is battery life,it's amazing. Runtime depends on usage but definitely it will give you more than any other headset.Should go for it..",Himanshu  Ghotkar,REAL
